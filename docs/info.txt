Welcome to Latitude, our luxury apartment community. We offer a variety of thoughtfully designed 
floor plans to suit your lifestyle needs. Our community features modern amenities including a 
resort-style pool, state-of-the-art clubhouse, and a convenient 24/7 package center for secure 
deliveries. The clubhouse is available for resident event rentals with applicable fees, though 
the pool area remains open for all residents' enjoyment and cannot be reserved privately.

Our Studio collection features the S series, a cozy and efficient living space complete with one 
full bathroom. At six hundred forty square feet, these homes are currently priced between fourteen 
hundred thirty-eight and fourteen hundred eighty-eight dollars monthly. In our One Bedroom collection, 
the A series offers modern layouts at seven hundred twenty-two square feet, with monthly rates from 
fifteen hundred twenty-three to seventeen hundred seventy-four dollars. The premium AX series provides 
seven hundred fifty-seven square feet of living space, priced between eighteen hundred twenty-eight and 
nineteen hundred three dollars. Our B series features a spacious seven hundred fifty-nine square foot 
layout at a fixed rate of seventeen hundred eighty-one dollars.

For our pet-loving residents, Latitude is a pet-friendly community with a dedicated pet washing 
station on the property. We welcome up to two pets per apartment, though breed restrictions apply. 
Guest pets must be registered with the office prior to visiting. Pet rent and deposits are required 
for resident pets. We understand the importance of maintaining a clean living environment, which is 
why we provide quarterly pest control services to all units as part of our regular maintenance schedule.

Resident comfort and convenience are our priorities. Our business center offers complimentary printing 
services, and all units are high-speed internet ready with multiple provider options available. Bike 
racks are conveniently located throughout the property for our cycling enthusiasts. We maintain a vibrant 
community atmosphere by hosting monthly resident social events in our clubhouse.

When it comes to payments and leasing, we offer flexible options including ACH (preferred), credit card 
payments (3% fee applies), and checks through our convenient online payment portal. Lease terms are typically 
12 months, and rental concessions can be prorated across the lease term when available. For residents 
interested in transferring to different units within the community, transfer fees apply and availability 
varies.

Our community guidelines are designed to ensure comfort and safety for all residents. Moving hours are 
from 9 AM to 6 PM to minimize disruption. While grills are not permitted on balconies due to fire code 
regulations, residents may customize their homes with management approval. This includes mounting TVs 
and changing fixtures, provided everything is restored to its original condition upon move-out.

The leasing office operates Monday through Friday from 9 AM to 6 PM, Saturdays from 10 AM to 5 PM, and 
Sundays from 12 PM to 4 PM. We understand that prospective residents may have busy schedules, so private 
tours are available by appointment, and we offer virtual tours for added convenience. Our ADA-compliant 
units are available in select floor plans, and we can discuss specific accessibility modifications as needed.

Additional services at Latitude include reserved covered parking for $50 monthly, storage units starting 
at $75 monthly, and complimentary trash valet service. Our package center ensures secure delivery storage, 
and notary services are available during office hours. Security is paramount, with features including gated
community access, 24/7 video surveillance, well-lit parking areas, controlled access buildings, and an 
emergency maintenance line.
